        <p>The 2022 season was turbulent for the Totenham Hotspurs. Although their season started
          off strong, injury woes as well as an upcoming worldcup mean't players weren't performing 
          at their highest level. Due to this cuppled with managerial problems, spurs ended the season 
          in 8th place, their lowest finish since the 08/09 season. Due to this under performance, Tottenham
          didn't qualify for any European tournaments such as the champions league or europa league. Although it was 
          a bleak end to the season, many fans were optimistic that next season would be better, that was until Harry Kane left.
          Harry Kane had played for Tottenham for 19 years, joining the clubs academy when he was only 11 years old. There he flourished 
          until he was eventually brought into the first team. The rest is history, with Kane putting up a staggering total 
          of 280 goals while playing for LilyWhites. In other words he was the Lebron James of Tottenham, and many fans thought that without Harry Kane,
          the previous season woes would carry over into the 2023 season. But so far, the opposite has happened.

          <p>The start to Tottenhams 2023 season has been nothing short of perfect. With 6 wins
            and 2 draws in the first 8 games this season, not only are tottenham curerntly in first place,
            but this is also their best ever start to a season since the Premier Leagues inception in 1992. A lot of speculation 
            could be made about the reason for this upward momentum of success, but I think two reasons 
            stand alone from the others in being defining factors of our success. These two factors our of course, the new manager, and new signings.
