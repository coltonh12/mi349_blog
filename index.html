        <p>As the 2023 champions league tournament kicked off just over a month ago,
          now is the perfect time to take a look at likely favorites, as well potential
          cinderlla stories. To understand the current favorites, its first important to look at
          who did well in the competition last year. The winners of the 2022 champions league were 
          Manchester City. Under their manager Pep Guardiola, City have continued to dominate
          heading into the 2023 season and have their eyes set on back to back trophies.
          Other strong contenders who performed well last season include Real Madrid, Bayern Munich,
          and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).</p>
